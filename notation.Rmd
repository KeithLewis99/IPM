## Subscripts  
a = age (2:4; not age 0 or 1 or $5^+$)    
t = time (year from start of spring acoustic survey: 1985-present)  
s = survey (not applicable: currently used as only spring acoustic survey is part of the model although it is hoped that the USSR data could be used eventually)

## Covariates 
<!-- PMR: simplified covariate symbols.  KL: I know Edwards recommends one letter per variable but C is also used for Catch-at-age and I wanted to keep the covariates consistent -->
$TI_t$ = t~*ice*~ or timing of the ice retreat from most southerly latitude in the year of the spring acoustic survey; a proxy for stratification (1969-present)  
$LD_{t-2}$ = larval density  (2001-present) two years prior to the acoustic survey  
$CO_{t-1}$ = capelin condition in the fall prior to the acoustic survey (1995-present)

** Note that all covariates are centered and scaled using function scale.**
** Need age disaggregated condition **

### Process variables
$N_{a,t}$ = natural log of population at age by survey and year  
$S_{a,t}$ = survival  (only for age-2 and age-3)  
$R_{t}$ = recruits in the current year???  

### Observation varaibles
$I_{s,a,t}$ = observed population by age, year, and survey  (1985-present); (s=1 in this case as only spring acoustic has been included)  
$m_{a,t}$ = proportion mature at age and year  (1985-present)  
$C_{a,t}$ = catch-at-age (1985-present)  

### Assumed
Not included below
$q_{s}$ = catchability by survey  


## State Space Model  

### Priors

#### Precision
Variance in JAGS is dealt with as precision, i.e., 1/variance.  Note that upper bounds on uniform distribution are subject to change.

Process error:  
$$
\sigma_{proc} \sim Unif(0.01, 20) \\
\tau_{proc} = 1/\sigma^2_{proc} 
$$
Observation error: 
$$
\sigma_{obs} \sim Unif(0.01, 10) \\
\tau_{obs} = 1/\sigma^2_{obs} 
$$

Maturity error: 
$$
\sigma_{mat} \sim Unif(0.01, 1) \\
\tau_{mat} = 1/\sigma^2_{mat} 
$$
A maturity prior may not be needed if we use the Beta distribution.


#### Variables   
For maturity-at-age, *mat* is the raw data and *m* is the variable used in models below. $\tau_{mat}$ is estimated as above.


$$
logit(\hat{m}_{a,t}) = Norm(logit(m_{a,t}), \tau_{m}) \\
m_{a,t} = ilogit(logit(\hat{m}_{a,t}))
$$
The problem with the above is that it creates values <0 and >1 which is mathematically impossible on the ln scale for the former and not biologically possible for the latter.  

I think that a better approach would be below because the Beta is the "only standard continuous distribution besides the uniform distribution with a finite range , from 0 to 1, i.e., it is the inferred distribution of the probability of success in a binomial trial with a-1 observed successes and b-1 observed failures. ...  It is good for modelling probabilities or proportions."  See Bolker 2008 pg 133-4.

$$
m_{a,t} \sim dbeta(a-1, b-1)
$$
So, a = $mat_{t,a}$ and b = $1-mat_{t,a}$.  I have multiplied both by 10 because, according to Bolker, this is the right scale.  Using plot(density(rbeta(10000, 90, 10))), I have experimented wth what to multiply a-1 and b-1 by. The higher the number, the tighter the distribution with decimals (e.g., 0.9 & 0.1 giving a spike near 1.0 and a very long tail while 900 & 100 give a more uniform distribution between 0.88 and 0.92).  

This eliminates the <0 and >1 problem that held me up for so long in the fall.

#### Parameters (see equations below):

$$ 
\alpha_a \sim Norm(0, 100^{-2}) \\
\beta_a \sim Norm(0, 100^{-2}) \\
\gamma_a \sim Unif(0.01, 100)  \\
\delta_a \sim \Gamma(11.5, 5.7) \\
\ E_a \sim Norm(0, 100^{-2}) \\
$$


### Process equations

#### Age-2
Following Murphy et al (2018):  

$$
\tag{1}
N_{2,t} = \alpha_2 + \beta_2*LD_{t-2} + \epsilon_t
$$
where LD <!-- PMR: is this logged? Maybe it should be.  KL: i'm not sure - I[a,t] is logged below so do we need to do it here??? --> is larval density as calculated at Bellevue Beach two years earlier (time series: 2001-present), $\alpha_2$ and $\beta_2$ are parameters a $\tau$ ~ N(0, $\sigma{2})$. 

Expanding upon this from Buren et al. (2014) and Lewis et al. (2019):

$$
\tag{2}
N_{2,t} = \alpha_2 + \beta_2*LD_{t-2} + \gamma_2*TI_t*(1-TI_t/\delta_2) + \tau_t \\   
N_{2,t} = \alpha_2 + \beta_2*LD_{t-2} + \gamma_2*TI_t*(1-TI_t/\delta_2) + \ E_2*CO_{t-1} + \tau_t 
$$

Where TI (or t~*ice*~) is timing of the ice retreat from the same calendar year and CO is the condition of capelin the previous fall.  For TI, the $gamma$ and $delta$ parameters are the peak and width for the dome respectively.  
Note that Buren et al. (2014) did not have an intercept in their equation in their dome-shaped model.  This was added by Lewis et al. (2019 - see Fig. 4) when combining the regression of Murphy et al. (2018) with the dome-shaped model.  

So, I was using this approach until recently (December 2022):


\begin{equation*}
\tag{3}
  mu_{2,t} = \left\{ 
  \begin{matrix}
    \alpha_2 + \gamma_2*TI_t*(1-TI_t/\delta_2) & , & 1985-1995 \\ 
    
    \alpha_2 + \gamma_2*TI_t*(1-TI_t/\delta_2) + \epsilon_2*CO_{t-1} & , & 1996-2002 or  \\
    N_{t-1} + u & , & 1985-2002 \\ 
    \alpha_2 + \beta_2*LD_{t-2} + \gamma_2*TI_t*(1-TI_t/\delta_2) + \ E_2*CO_{t-1} & , & 2003-present
  \end{matrix}
  \right\}
\end{equation*}


$$
N_{2,t} \sim Norm(mu_{2,t}, \tau_{proc})
$$

Note that for stochastic variables, i'll present precision rather than variance to follow JAGS.  
Note that this works well for the forecast model because it only ran from 2003 to the present so all these variables could be used.  Further, the forecast model was trying to predict biomass and there's a strong correlation between age-2 biomass and total biomass during this time period.  

Note also that I really don't like the first two terms (1985-1995, and 1996-2002) because they miss the key variable which is LD.  It seems like LD provides the strength of the pulse of capelin which is modified by environmental conditions both directly through t~*ice*~ and indirectly through CO, i.e., food. But this is lacking from the earlier years^1^.
**Perhaps one way to get at LD pre-2003 is to use the abundance as an indicator with a very loose prior? This assumes some sort of SRR which we don't have but perhaps it will put it in the ball park.  But perhaps a random walk will do the trick????**
<!-- PMR: using abundance as a prior would be circular as you're using abundance as an input, so it is getting information on the size and variability of N2 from that. For those pre 2003 blocks, the alpha will provide a baseline level of abundance but a random walk or stock recruit function would allow for some variability. KL: sorry, that wasn't clear. As I wrote it, yes, it is circular.    What I meant was to use N2[t-1] as a prior for N2[t] and then got the idea for a rdm walk as I think the SRR would not be as good an approach.  -->

So, the below for 1985-2002 but with an informative prior on 1985 and 1991 (implemented in ~ Dec 2022).

$$
mu_{t,1} =  N_{t-1,1} \\
N_{t,1} \sim Norm(mu_{t,1}, \tau_{proc})
$$


#### Age-3 and 4+
I then reasoned that because t~*ice*~ and, to a lesser extent CO, were useful predictors of biomass, that they could also be useful predictors of survival as follows.   
$$
\begin{equation*}
\tag{4}
  x_{3,t} = \left\{ 
  \begin{matrix}
    \alpha_3 + \gamma*TI_t*(1-TI_t/\delta) & , & 1985-1995 \\ 
    \alpha_3 + \gamma*TI_t*(1-TI_t/\delta) + \ E_2*CO_{t-1} & , & 2003-present
  \end{matrix}
  \right\}
\end{equation*} \\
  \\[1cm]
S_{3,t} = ilogit(x_{3,t}) 
$$
Where *x* is a parameter used to calculate a survival rate *S*.  

Note: Need a better term than "x" but "logit_s" as it is in the JAGS code is confusing. 

Based on our discussion, we re-formulated the above as follows:
$$
\begin{equation*}
\tag{5}
  x_{3,t} = \left\{ 
  \begin{matrix}
    \gamma_2*TI_t*(1-TI_t/\delta_2) & , & 1985-1995 \\ 
    \gamma_2*TI_t*(1-TI_t/\delta_2) + \ E_2*CO_{t-1} & , & 2003-present
  \end{matrix}
  \right\}
\end{equation*} \\
  \\[1cm]
S_{3,t} = x_{3,t}/(\gamma_2*(\delta_2/2)*(1-\delta_2/2)/\delta_2)
$$
Paul has also suggested this equation which seems to work well.
$$
\tag{6}
x_{3,t} = \gamma_2*4*TI_t/\delta_2*(1-TI_t/\delta_2)
$$


Then, a basic and more complicated equation to get from age-2[t] to age-3[t+1].  The latter equation was added because of the issues with getting *S* = 1.0.   One explanation for this is that there are often more or ~ as many age-3[t+1] as age-2[t].  So, either the survey missed age-2 fish, the Trinity Bay fish are important, or lots of capelin recover.  However, the reformulated dome-model (eqn 5 or eqn 6) has alleviated this issue somewhat. **Need to zero in on the "right" equation**

*PMR: while the scaling to the max does resolve S issue to a degree, the gamma parameter no longer has an effect and S will equal 1 if ice timing is optimal. The condition effect may also produce S values > 1. We need to work out a better solution for a linear predictor of S.*
*KL: Agreed.  I'll note that I did check for the scenario where S=1 when TI=delta/2 and didn't get exactly there results.*


Below is the way I have been doing things based on eqn 5. 

$$\begin{aligned}
& N_{3,t+1} \sim N(N_{2,t}*(1-m_t)*S_{2,t}, \tau_{proc}) \\
& N_{3,t+1} \sim N(N_{2,t}*(1-m_t)*S_{2,t} + N^{TB}_2 + N_{2,t}*m_t*R^{sp}_{2,t}*S_{2,t}*a - C_{2,t}, \tau_{proc})\\
\end{aligned}$$

where *m* is the maturity.  In the second equation $N^{TB}$ is the Trinity Bay survey,   $R^{sp}$ is the percentage of post-spawning females in the fall survey (Flynn et al.), *a* is a constant to modify *S* for the fraction of the year that the mature fish is migrating and spawning, and *C* is catch-at-age. In someways, this makes more sense than for age-2.  Age-2 fish are predicted by larval density at a single beach.  But here, age-2 from the survey supplies the raw material for age-3 *from the survey*, we just need to kill off the appropriate amount assuming that the survey is finding the ages equally.

<!-- PMR: the use of Trinity Bay data would be better placed in the observation equations. KL: right - I forgot to put those in.  Have done so in the code - my bad. Will put this in the next iteration if we decide that's the way to go -->

Note that these equations do not have a term for spawning migration mortality which must be massive!
Note that i'm only showing the equations for age-3 as the 4+ are identical.

#### Schaekell eqns
For reference, the above is similar to Schaekel et al. (1994).

$$
\tag{7}
N_{a,t+1} = N_{a,t}*(1-m_t)*S_{i} + (N_{a,t} - C_{a,t})*S_m + \epsilon_{a+1, t+1}
$$

where $S_i$ and $S_m$ are survival for immature and mature capelin respectively.  These were arrived at through simple OLS regression and have now been incorporated into a model.  
<!-- PMR: Is your basic demographic model a version of this? I would be really curious to see estimates from a state-space version of this. We could think of it as a NULL model compared to your more extensive IPM. KL: my basic model is the left half but I have done something similar to the whole equation in other runs but I have things like recovery in too. -->

Do we want
N2 - 
1985-1990: rdm walk modified by ice
1991-2002: rdm walk modified by ice and condition
2003-present: forecast model

split N2 into mature and immature and when a >= 2, 

$$
\tag{8}
N_{a,t+1} = [(N_{a,t}*(1-m_t)+ NTB_{a,t}*(1-mTB)]*S_{i} + (N_{a,t} - C_{a,t})*S_m + \epsilon_{a+1, t+1}
$$
Where TB is the Trinity Bay fish (assume all immature (but check this) and the Schaekel equation allows for fish to survive spawning


### PR/MKA
MKA pointed out that my new approach for using random walk from 1985-1990 and 1991-2002 and then modelling from 2003-present is a bit of a Frankenstein monster, i.e., its pieced together and not consisten (see OneNote).  After some debate, they came up with this.  

Process equations:

$$
N_{1,t} \sim Norm(N_{1, t-1}, \tau_{proc}) \\
N_{2,t} \sim Norm(N_{2, t-1}*S_{2,t}, \tau_{proc}) \\
N_{3,t} \sim Norm(N_{3, t-1}*S_{3,t}, \tau_{proc}) \\
N_{4,t} \sim Norm(N_{4, t-1}*S_{4,t}, \tau_{proc}) \\
$$

Where N1 is age-1 capelin and are a random latent variable. Observation equations are as below with this addition:
$$
LD_{t-1} \sim Norm(q*N_{1,t} + \epsilon_i)
$$
and q is an estimate of catchability (see above).  


### Observation equation

I~a,t~ = natural logarithm of the acoustic survey abundance or biomass by age.

$$
I_{2,t}  \sim logNormal(N_2, \tau_{obs}) \\
I_{3,t}  \sim logNormal(N_3, \tau_{obs}) \\
I_{4+,t}  \sim logNormal(N_4, \tau_{obs}) \\
$$ 

Note that haven't incorporated survey variation into the model.  

## Recrtuitment Model
Larval density at Bellevue  

I think this is redundant now but may be useful if we want to bring variation into the model.

My reasoning here is that Larval Density (LD) is a reasonable predictor of age 2 capelin (Recruitment).  Age 1 are not well recruited to the survey.  A good point was raised the other day about how to scale this from larval density at Bellevue to the acoustic survey.

$$
N_{2_{t+2}} = LD_{a,t}S_{lar_{a}} + \epsilon_{LD_{t}} \\
R_{y+2} \sim logNormal(LD_{a,y}, \sigma_{LD_{y}}) \\
L_{R}(S_{lar}|LD) \\
$$
